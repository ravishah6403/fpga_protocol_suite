# FPGA Protocol Suite – Tang Nano 20K

A reusable and modular **communication protocol suite** implemented on the **Sipeed Tang Nano 20K FPGA**.  
This project provides **parameterized IP cores** for commonly used digital interfaces such as **I²C, UART, SPI, and Ethernet**, verified through simulation and hardware integration.

---

## Features
- **I²C** – configurable clock speed, supports multiple devices.  
- **UART** – parameterized baud rate, data bits, and stop bits.  
- **SPI** – configurable modes (CPOL/CPHA).
